## Deskripsi Tugas:
// Consider a car-rental system shown in Fig.2.72, with all distances given in miles.
// People arrive at location i (where i = 1, 2, 3) with independent exponential interarrival times at respective rates of 14, 10, and 24 per hour.
// Each location has a FIFO queue with unlimited capacity. There is one bus with a capacity of 20 people and a speed of 30 miles per hour.
// The bus is initially at location 3(car rental), and leaves immediately in a counterclockwise direction.
// All people arriving at a terminal want to go to the car rental.All people arriving at the car rental want to go to terminals I and 2 with respective probabilities 0.583 and 0.417.
// When a bus arrives at a location, the following rules apply:
// ㆍPeople are first unloaded in a FIFO manner. The time to unload one person is distributed uniformly between 16 and 24 seconds.
// ㆍPeople are then loaded on the bus up to its capacity, with a loading time per person that is distributed uniformly between 15 and 25 seconds.
// ㆍThe bus always spends at least 5 minutes at each location. If no loading or unloading is in process after 5 minutes, the bus will leave immediately.
// Run a simulation for 80 hours and gather statistics
